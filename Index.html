<h3 style="color:lightskyblue;"/>The Road To Hope </h3>
<p style="font-family:courier;"> Hello! My name is Tantum Woolley, but I go by Tate. I am from Denver, CO and am 19 years old. 
Some of my hobbies and interests include service work, lacrosse, field hockey, photography, and traveling. 
In high school I got really involved in service and was able to serve on a board for a non-profit organization by the name of Road To Hope. The mission 
of this organization was to progress the education in Haiti and allow for these students to not only go to
school, but to stay in school and eventually finish high school and hopefully continue on to a university. At the school three meals are provided a day which is also something that works 
as an incentive to get the students to show up. Most of the time the children are only getting one or two meals at home each day, so it's a big benefit.
I have been to Haiti three times, each trip helping further build the infrastructure. These trips absolutely changed
my life and one day I intend on living in Haiti and working at these schools for a few years. I am now at
theUniversity of Georgia with an intended co-major in international business and marketing. My dream is 
to one day run my own international nonprofit that will continue to benefit the children in Haiti and provide
them with the tools and confidence to pursue whatever aspirations they have.
